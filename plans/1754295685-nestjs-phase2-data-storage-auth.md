# Phase 2: Data Storage & User Access

**Date:** August 4, 2025  
**Focus:** Secure database setup and authentication system  
**Duration:** 4-5 days  
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 (Foundation) completed

## What We're Building

### The Alumni Database
A secure, fast database that safely stores all alumni information and supports quick searching even with hundreds of profiles.

**Key Outcomes:**
- All alumni information stored securely in PostgreSQL
- Separate secure storage for login credentials vs. profile information
- Database designed for fast searching and filtering
- Proper data protection for sensitive information

### User Access Control System
Complete authentication system that manages who can access what, with admin approval workflow for profile visibility.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Alumni can create accounts and log in securely
- System remembers logged-in users across sessions
- Admin can control which profiles are visible to other alumni
- Password recovery system for forgotten credentials
- Security measures protect against unauthorized access

## Success Criteria

**For Alumni Users:**
- [ ] Can create new accounts with email and password
- [ ] Can log in and stay logged in across browser sessions
- [ ] Can reset forgotten passwords via email
- [ ] Profile information is safely stored and retrievable
- [ ] Only approved profiles are visible to other alumni

**For Administrators:**
- [ ] Can see all pending profile approvals
- [ ] Can approve profiles to make them visible
- [ ] Can manage user access and roles
- [ ] Has oversight of all platform activity

**For System Security:**
- [ ] Passwords are securely encrypted and stored
- [ ] User sessions are managed safely
- [ ] Only authorized users can access alumni information
- [ ] System protects against common security threats

## Core Features

### 1. Alumni Profile Data Storage
Complete database structure for storing:
- Basic information (name, email, graduation year, NIM)
- Education details (concentration, batch, student organizations)
- Career information (current company, position, industry)
- Personal touches (bio, achievements, social media links)
- Contact information (phone, address, location)
- Professional details (skills, years of experience)

### 2. Authentication System
Secure login system featuring:
- Email/password registration and login
- Secure password storage with industry-standard encryption
- Session management that keeps users logged in safely
- Password reset via email with secure token system
- Protection against brute force attacks and unauthorized access

### 3. Admin Approval Workflow
Profile visibility control system:
- New alumni profiles start as "pending approval"
- Admin can review and approve profiles
- Only approved profiles appear in alumni directory
- Alumni can still edit their profiles while pending approval
- Clear status indicators for both alumni and admin

### 4. Data Security & Performance
Database optimization for:
- Fast search across all alumni profiles
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Efficient filtering by graduation year, company, location, etc.
- Data backup and recovery capabilities
- Performance that scales with growing alumni base

## What This Enables

After this phase:
- Alumni can safely create accounts and manage their login credentials
- The platform has a secure foundation for storing all alumni data
- Admin has full control over profile visibility and user management
- The system is ready for building the alumni directory and search features
- Security measures protect user data from unauthorized access

## Key Focus Areas

### 1. Database Design
Create efficient storage for:
- User authentication data (separate from profile data)
- Complete alumni profiles with all requested fields
- Admin approval status and workflow data
- Audit trails for security and compliance

### 2. Authentication Security
Implement robust security for:
- Password encryption and storage
- Session management and token security
- Password reset workflow with email verification
- Protection against common attack vectors

### 3. Admin Controls
Build administrative capabilities for:
- Profile approval workflow
- User role management
- Platform oversight and monitoring
- Security incident response

## Next Steps After Completion

Once Phase 2 is complete, we'll move to Phase 3 (Alumni Profiles & Directory) where we'll:
- Build the complete alumni profile management system
- Create the searchable alumni directory
- Implement profile photo upload functionality
- Add advanced search and filtering capabilities

This phase establishes the secure foundation that makes all alumni platform features possible.

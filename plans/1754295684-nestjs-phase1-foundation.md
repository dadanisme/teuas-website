# Phase 1: Foundation - Getting Started

**Date:** August 4, 2025  
**Focus:** Set up clean, modern backend system and shared type definitions  
**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Prerequisites:** None (fresh start)

## What We're Building

### The New Backend Structure
We're replacing the old Express.js system with a fresh NestJS application that will serve as the foundation for all alumni platform features.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Clean, empty NestJS application running successfully
- Well-organized codebase structure that's easy to maintain and extend
- Ready foundation for building authentication, alumni profiles, and all future features

### Shared Understanding Between Frontend & Backend
Create common definitions so both systems speak the same language about data structures and API contracts.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Alumni data structure clearly defined (name, email, graduation info, career details, etc.)
- API request/response formats standardized
- Validation rules shared between frontend and backend
- Type safety ensuring no data mismatches

## Success Criteria

**Technical Readiness:**
- [ ] NestJS application starts without errors
- [ ] Basic project structure follows best practices
- [ ] Shared package contains all necessary type definitions
- [ ] Both frontend and backend can use shared types without conflicts

**Development Experience:**
- [ ] Code is clean and well-organized
- [ ] Adding new features will be straightforward
- [ ] TypeScript provides full type safety
- [ ] Development workflow is smooth and efficient

## What This Enables

After this phase:
- Developers can confidently build features knowing the foundation is solid
- Frontend integration will be seamless due to shared type definitions
- The codebase will scale gracefully as we add more features
- Future maintenance and improvements will be manageable

## Key Focus Areas

### 1. Clean Architecture
Set up NestJS with a structure that supports:
- Authentication system
- Alumni profile management
- File upload capabilities
- Admin controls
- Future feature additions

### 2. Type Safety
Establish comprehensive type definitions for:
- Alumni profile data (all the fields from graduation to current career)
- User authentication data
- API request/response formats
- File upload specifications
- Admin approval workflows

### 3. Development Standards
Create consistent patterns for:
- Code organization and naming
- Error handling approaches
- Validation strategies
- Documentation standards

## Next Steps After Completion

Once Phase 1 is complete, we'll move to Phase 2 (Data Storage & User Access) where we'll:
- Set up the PostgreSQL database
- Implement secure user authentication
- Create the admin approval system
- Establish data protection measures

This phase sets the stage for everything that follows, ensuring we build the alumni platform on a rock-solid foundation.
